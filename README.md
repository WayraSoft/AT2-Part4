Assessment Part 4 – Data structures and algorithms – complex data types.

1.	Define a movie class with the following properties.
•	Movie ID
•	Title
•	Year
•	Rating
2.	Create an array of at least 10 movies with mock values
•	Movie ID must be unique for each movie.
•	Movie ID must not be sorted in the array
3.	Sort array by Movie ID in ascending order
4.	Implement at least one search algorithm (sequential search or binary search)
•	This function accepts two parameters: an array and a movie ID
•	This function searches the input array for the input movie ID using selected searching algorithm
•	You cannot use the JavaScript build-in “find” function. You must implement the algorithm with your own code.
•	This function returns the movie object found or return “null” if not found

The operations need to be done using JavaScript programming language and the result need to be verified using browser.
